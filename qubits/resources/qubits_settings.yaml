## SIMULATED SURVEY CONSTRAINTS ##
Extra Survey Constraints:
    Faint-Limit of Peak Magnitude: 21.50 # The lower-limit of the apparent peak magnitude so that the transient can be distinguished from other flavours of transients. Set this to 99.9 for this setting to be disregarded.
    Observable for at least ? number of days: 75 # Set this to 1 for this setting to be distregarded
Lower Redshift Limit: 0.00 ## Usually set to 0.0s
Upper Redshift Limit: 1.0
Redshift Resolution: 0.1 ## Higher resolution (lower number) means the simulations are more accuate but the code shall take long to run, especially for the k-correction database generation.
Sky Area of the Survey (square degrees): 70
Limiting Magnitudes:
    g : 23.0
    r : 23.0
    i : 23.0
    z : 22.4
Survey Cadence:

    Fraction of Year Lost to Weather etc: 0.4

## K-CORRECTION GENERATION ##
Rest Frame Filter for K-corrections: g # This is the filter that the k-corrections are anchored to. The simulations will convert from this observed band magnitude to the rest frame magnitudes to calculate the k-correction.
K-correction temporal resolution (days): 1.0 # Only increase the resolution here if you have many spectra in your database and k-corrections are taking too long to generate.
Order of polynomial used to fits k-corrections: 10 # Check the k-correction polynomial plots and tweak this value as needed.
Minimum number of datapoints used to generate k-correction curve: 3 # If the are not enough spectra or too many spectra have been redshifted out of the range of the observed frame band-pass, then there are few points to generate a polynomial k-correction lightcurve. 3 is probably the barely-passable minimum.

## SIMULATED UNIVERSE CONSTRAINTS ##
CCSN Progenitor Population Fraction of IMF: 0.007
Transient to CCSN Ratio: 10e-5
Simulation Sample: 200 # Number of transients to include in simulations. More = more accurate but sims take longer to run. 100 good for testing & 10,000 good for science.
Extinctions:
    constant or random: constant # Feature not yet implemented - leave as `constant`
    constant E(b-v): 0.023 # 0.023 is the mean for the PS1-MD fields
    host: # Parameter not yet implemented
    galactic: # Parameter not yet implemented
Relative Rate Set to Use: SLSNe
Relative SN Rates:
    # MAKE SURE TRANSIENT NAME CORRESPOND TO FOLDER NAMES CONTAINING THIER SPECTRAL DATA-SETS
    SLSNe:
        SNOne: 0.5 # make sure transient names correspond to folder names containing thier spectral data-sets
        SNTwo: 0.5
SN Absolute Peak-Magnitude Distributions:
    magnitude:
        SNOne: -21.25
        SNTwo: -21.50
    sigma:
        SNOne: 0.25
        SNTwo: 0.15

## LIGHTCURVE GENERATION & CONSTRAINTS
Lightcurves:
    SNOne:
        End of lightcurve relative to peak: 300 # Constrain the end of the lightcurve so polynomial fits don't go awal
    SNTwo:
        End of lightcurve relative to peak: 220
Order of polynomial used to fits lightcurves: 6 # Check the extracted lightcurve plots and tweak this value as needed.
# Often it is useful to set a an explosion day (relative to the timescale used in naming the files in the spectral database).
# This helps constrain the polynomials of the light- and K-correction- curves generated in the simulations.
# SET TO `False` TO DISREGARD THIS SETTING
Explosion Days:
    SNOne: -50
    SNTwo: -50
# You can also extend the tail of the lightcurve to better constrain the polynomial. Set to `True` or `False`
Extend lightcurve tail?:
    SNOne: True
    SNTwo: True
